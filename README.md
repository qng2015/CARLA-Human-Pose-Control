# CARLA-Human-Pose-Control
Carla is an open source autonomous driving simulation that utilizes Unreal Engine. The control is done through Python and C++ API (this report used Python). However, what if I want to direct CARLA by using human pose. In this report will explain in detail the steps needed to install and run Carla and my python program in **windows operating system**

On this screen, check the requirements. Since I plan to run it on Windows, I only needed to make sure that I had enough hard drive space and Python installed along with the Pygame module. More on Python later. Scroll down to “B. Package installation” and click on CARLA Repository button:
